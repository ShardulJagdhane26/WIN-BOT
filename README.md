# WIN-BOT
This project focuses on predicting the outcome of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) games using machine learning. By analyzing 29 gameplay features, such as weapon usage, headshot rates, and group rankings, we aim to build a model that estimates a player's likelihood of winning. The dataset undergoes extensive data wrangling to clean, organize, and prepare it for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Feature engineering enhances the dataset by normalizing features, creating new metrics like total kills, and reducing complexity by removing redundant data. For modeling, we use CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency with categorical data, automatic handling of missing values, and high accuracy. The model is evaluated using RMSE, ensuring reliable predictions. This project demonstrates the use of data science to uncover patterns in gameplay and predict success in complex battle royale scenarios.
